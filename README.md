# Welcome!

![](</Resources/Welcome_image.png>)

Welcome to the homepage for SP3172: Integrated Science Project. 

Here you'll find links to relevant rubrics and assignments for the module.

This course serves to initiate students into the arena of scientific investigation using project-based learning. The students get to design and to conduct laboratory experiments for their project under the supervision of mentors and PI. Here, students are strongly encouraged to undertake projects that integrates different discipline of science together. With the inter-disciplinary flavour, this course provides an avenue for students from several disciplines to work together and it also lays the foundation for further work in experimental science.

At the end of the module, the student should be able to:
1. Design, develop and implement a series of experiments to investigate a scientific question or hypothesis.
2. Able to critically analyse experimental data and present findings coherently.
3. Communicate and discuss experimental data through written and oral communication in the form of a scientific article and/or scientific conference presentation.
4. Develop critical thinking, troubleshooting and collaborative skills.
