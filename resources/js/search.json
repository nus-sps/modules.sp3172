[[{"i":"welcome","l":"Welcome!","p":["Welcome to the homepage for SP3172: Integrated Science Project.","Here you'll find links to relevant rubrics and assignments for the module.","This course serves to initiate students into the arena of scientific investigation using project-based learning. The students get to design and to conduct laboratory experiments for their project under the supervision of mentors and PI. Here, students are strongly encouraged to undertake projects that integrates different discipline of science together. With the inter-disciplinary flavour, this course provides an avenue for students from several disciplines to work together and it also lays the foundation for further work in experimental science.","At the end of the module, the student should be able to:","Design, develop and implement a series of experiments to investigate a scientific question or hypothesis.","Able to critically analyse experimental data and present findings coherently.","Communicate and discuss experimental data through written and oral communication in the form of a scientific article and/or scientific conference presentation.","Develop critical thinking, troubleshooting and collaborative skills."]},{"l":"Course Weightage","p":["Component","Weightage","Written Report","30% (Group)","Poster Presentation","10% (Group)","Oral Presentation (Congress)","20% (Individual)","Oral Viva Examination","15% (Individual)","Learning Reflections","Continuous Assessment","10% (Individual)","Note: the information given is subject to changes"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Schedule AY23/24"]},{"l":"Schedule","p":["-1/0","1","10","11","12","13","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","Confirm student/mentor grouping and PI","Contact graders to arrange viva timing","Deliverable","Mock Presentation","Note: the information given is subject to changes","Recess week","Remarks","Report due Monday 1200hr, Contact graders to arrange viva timing","Report Submission, Viva Presentation","Student Learning Journal Submission","Viva Presentation, SP3172 Congress","Week"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Assessments and Assessors"]},{"l":"Assessments and Assessors","p":["* In the case that a group has more than one Staff Supervisor, the main Staff Supervisor will be the personnel grading.","❌","Component","Congress Grader [Graduate mentor who are not mentoring any group]","Congress Graders","Continuous Assessment","External Mentor","External Mentor [Student / graduate mentor]","Internal Mentor","Internal Mentor [Student / graduate mentor who is mentoring you]","Learning Reflections","Note: the information given is subject to changes","Oral Presentation (Congress)","Oral Viva Examination","Poster Presentation","Project Staff Supervisor","Project Staff Supervisor [Academic staff whose lab you are working at*]","SPS Instructor","SPS Instructor [One of the SPS instructors / Professor Liou Yih-Cherng]","The components of SP3172 will be graded by the following assessors:","Written Report"]},{"l":"Assessment Details"},{"i":"written-report-30-group","l":"Written Report (30%, group)","p":["The SP3172 report should outline in detail all the choices made during the research process and why, as well as the outcomes of each phase of the research process. It should not be merely factual or explanatory; but rather interpretive and persuasive in nature. It should be the goal of the writer to use acceptable academic reasoning and argumentation to persuade the audience that your choice of experiments, results and conclusions are relevant to, and appropriate within the context of the main theme you have chosen. Furthermore, the research process must be described in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to replicate your study, test the findings, or assess whether the conclusion derived are scientifically acceptable. The written report should be accessible to a broad audience of scientists who may not be from the same field of research.","Structure of the written report","Title: A specific statement that conveys the topic and conclusion of the paper.","Abstract: A complete summary of the paper designed for experts and non-experts.","Introduction: The beginning of a paper that transitions from a general background to a specific research question or goal.","Materials and Methods: A brief but detailed description about the tools and methods you used to perform experiments and analyse results.","Results: A presentation of all your experiments and data, represented both as text and in tables, charts, diagrams, and photographs.","Discussion: An opportunity to discuss your interpretation of your results and explore your findings within the context of the larger scientific record.","References: Your citations. There is no specific style required, students can use either APA, or Harvard style of referencing. Once you have determined the method to follow, use it consistently in your report.","Supplemental Material/appendix: Additional figures, videos, and elaboration on methods and computational analysis."]},{"i":"poster-presentation-10-group","l":"Poster presentation (10%, group)","p":["The purpose of a scientific poster is to visually present a summary of your research that complements your interactions with other SPS students or examiner during a poster session.

Students are recommended to be consistently and actively involved in their project and maintain favourable group dynamics with other members of the group.","Duration: The duration over which the continual assessment takes place will be the entire course of the project, from start to end.
