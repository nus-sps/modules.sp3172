[[{"i":"welcome","l":"Welcome!","p":["Welcome to the homepage for SP3172: Integrated Science Project.","Here you'll find links to relevant rubrics and assignments for the module.","This course serves to initiate students into the arena of scientific investigation using project-based learning. The students get to design and to conduct laboratory experiments for their project under the supervision of mentors and PI. Here, students are strongly encouraged to undertake projects that integrates different discipline of science together. With the inter-disciplinary flavour, this course provides an avenue for students from several disciplines to work together and it also lays the foundation for further work in experimental science.","At the end of the module, the student should be able to:","Design, develop and implement a series of experiments to investigate a scientific question or hypothesis.","Able to critically analyse experimental data and present findings coherently.","Communicate and discuss experimental data through written and oral communication in the form of a scientific article and/or scientific conference presentation.","Develop critical thinking, troubleshooting and collaborative skills."]},{"l":"Course Weightage","p":["Component","Weightage","Written Report","30% (Group)","Poster Presentation","10% (Group)","Oral Presentation (Congress)","20% (Individual)","Oral Viva Examination","15% (Individual)","Learning Reflections","Continuous Assessment","10% (Individual)","Note: the information given is subject to changes"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Schedule AY23/24"]},{"l":"Schedule","p":["-1/0","1","10","11","12","13","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","Confirm student/mentor grouping and PI","Contact graders to arrange viva timing","Deliverable","Mock Presentation","Note: the information given is subject to changes","Recess week","Remarks","Report due Monday 1200hr, Contact graders to arrange viva timing","Report Submission, Viva Presentation","Student Learning Journal Submission","Viva Presentation, SP3172 Congress","Week"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Assessments and Assessors"]},{"l":"Assessments and Assessors","p":["* In the case that a group has more than one Staff Supervisor, the main Staff Supervisor will be the personnel grading.","‚ùå","Component / Assessor","Congress Grader [Graduate mentor who are not mentoring any group]","Congress Graders","Continuous Assessment","External Mentor","External Mentor [Student / graduate mentor]","Internal Mentor","Internal Mentor [Student / graduate mentor who is mentoring you]","Learning Reflections","Note: the information given is subject to changes","Oral Presentation (Congress)","Oral Viva Examination","Poster Presentation","Project Staff Supervisor","Project Staff Supervisor [Academic staff whose lab you are working at*]","SPS Instructor","SPS Instructor [One of the SPS instructors / Professor Liou Yih- Cherng]","The components of SP3172 will be graded by the following assessors:","Written Report"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["SP3172 Congress"]},{"l":"Details","p":["Each group will be allocated a 25-minute time slot, comprising of 15 minutes of presentation, 7 minutes of Q&A and 3 minutes of buffer time to set up the slides and to pack up after the entire presentation.","All students should arrive punctually and attend the whole duration of SP3172 congress.
