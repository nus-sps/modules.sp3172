The students get to design and to conduct laboratory experiments for their project under the supervision of mentors and PI. Here, students are strongly encouraged to undertake projects that integrates different discipline of science together. With the inter-disciplinary flavour, this course provides an avenue for students from several disciplines to work together and also lays the foundation for further work in experimental science.","At the end of the module, the student should be able to:","Design, develop and implement a series of experiments to investigate a scientific question or hypothesis.","Critically analyse experimental data and present findings coherently.","Communicate and discuss experimental data through written and oral communication in the form of a scientific article and/or scientific conference presentation.","Develop critical thinking, troubleshoot and collaborate."]},{"l":"Course Weightage","p":["Component","Weightage","Basis","Written Report","30%","Group","Poster Presentation","10%","Mid Semester Presentation and Abstract","Oral Presentation (Congress)","20%","Individual","Oral Viva Examination","Continuous Assessment"]},{"l":"Further Information","p":["For more details on SP3172 for AY24/25, the course briefing slide deck may be referenced.","The official course page on NUS CANVAS may also be accessed for announcements and specific information.","Note: the information given is subject to change"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Schedule AY24/25"]},{"l":"Schedule","p":["-1/0","1","10","11","12","13","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","Abstract and presentation deadlines to be determined","Confirm student/mentor grouping and PI","Congress on Saturday 19th April, poster to be printed and submitted on CANVAS","Deliverable","Mid Sem Abstract, Mid Sem Presentation","Note: the information given is subject to change","Recess Week","Remarks","Report due Monday 7th April 12pm, contact graders to arrange viva timing","SP3172 Congress, Oral Viva Examination","Student Progress Check-In","Week","Written Report Submission, Oral Viva Examination"]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Assessments and Assessors"]},{"l":"Assessments and Assessors","p":["* In the case that a group has more than one Staff Supervisor, the main Staff Supervisor will be the personnel grading.","✔️","Component","Congress Grader [Graduate mentor who are not mentoring any group]","Congress Graders","Continuous Assessment","External Mentor","External Mentor [Student / graduate mentor]","Internal Mentor","Internal Mentor [Student / graduate mentor who is mentoring you]","Mid Semester Abstract/Presentation","Note: the information given is subject to changes","Oral Presentation (Congress)","Oral Viva Examination","Poster Presentation","Project Staff Supervisor","Project Staff Supervisor [Academic staff whose lab you are working at*]","SPS Instructor","SPS Instructor [One of the SPS instructors / Professor Liou Yih-Cherng]","The components of SP3172 will be graded by the following assessors:","Written Report"]},{"l":"Assessment Details"},{"l":"Written Report"},{"i":"30--group","l":"30% | Group","p":["The SP3172 report should outline in detail all the choices made during the research process and why, as well as the outcomes of each phase of the research process.

It should be the goal of the writer to use acceptable academic reasoning and argumentation to persuade the audience that your choice of experiments, results and conclusions are relevant to, and appropriate within the context of the main theme you have chosen. Furthermore, the research process must be described in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to replicate your study, test the findings, or assess whether the conclusion derived are scientifically acceptable.
