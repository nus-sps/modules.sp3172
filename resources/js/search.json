The students get to design and to conduct laboratory experiments for their project under the supervision of mentors and PI. Here, students are strongly encouraged to undertake projects that integrates different discipline of science together. With the inter-disciplinary flavour, this course provides an avenue for students from several disciplines to work together and also lays the foundation for further work in experimental science.","At the end of the module, the student should be able to:","Design, develop and implement a series of experiments to investigate a scientific question or hypothesis.","Critically analyse experimental data and present findings coherently.","Communicate and discuss experimental data through written and oral communication in the form of a scientific article and/or scientific conference presentation.","Develop critical thinking, troubleshoot and collaborate."]},{"l":"Course Weightage","p":["Component","Weightage","Basis","Written Report","30%","Group","Poster Presentation","10%","Mid Semester Presentation and Abstract","Oral Presentation (Congress)","20%","Individual","Oral Viva Examination","Continuous Assessment"]},{"l":"Further Information","p":["For more details on SP3172 for AY24/25, the course briefing slide deck may be referenced.

It should be the goal of the writer to use acceptable academic reasoning and argumentation to persuade the audience that your choice of experiments, results and conclusions are relevant to, and appropriate within the context of the main theme you have chosen. Furthermore, the research process must be described in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to replicate your study, test the findings, or assess whether the conclusion derived are scientifically acceptable.
