# Assessments and Assessors

The components of SP3172 will be graded by the following assessors: 
a) 	Project Staff Supervisor 	[Academic staff whose lab you are working at*] 
b) 	SPS Instructor			[One of the SPS instructors / Professor Liou Yih-Cherng] 
c) 	Internal Mentor 		[Student / graduate mentor who is mentoring you] 
d)	External Mentor 		[Student / graduate mentor] 
e) 	Congress Grader 		[Graduate mentor who are not mentoring any group] 

*In the case that a group has more than one Staff Supervisor, the main Staff Supervisor will be the personnel grading.

## Assessment Details

### Written Report (30%, group) 
The SP3172 report should outline in detail all the choices made during the research process and why, as well as the outcomes of each phase of the research process. It should not be merely factual or explanatory; but rather interpretive and persuasive in nature. It should be the goal of the writer to use acceptable academic reasoning and argumentation to persuade the audience that your choice of experiments, results and conclusions are relevant to, and appropriate within the context of the main theme you have chosen. Furthermore, the research process must be described in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to replicate your study, test the findings, or assess whether the conclusion derived are scientifically acceptable. The written report should be accessible to a broad audience of scientists who may not be from the same field of research. 

**Structure of the written report**
 
**Title**: A specific statement that conveys the topic and conclusion of the paper. 

**Abstract**: A complete summary of the paper designed for experts and non-experts. 

**Introduction**: The beginning of a paper that transitions from a general background to a specific research question or goal. 

**Materials and Methods**: A brief but detailed description about the tools and methods you used to perform experiments and analyse results. 

**Results**: A presentation of all your experiments and data, represented both as text and in tables, charts, diagrams, and photographs. 

**Discussion**: An opportunity to discuss your interpretation of your results and explore your findings within the context of the larger scientific record. 

**References**: Your citations. There is no specific style required, students can use either APA, or Harvard style of referencing. Once you have determined the method to follow, use it consistently in your report. 

**Supplemental Material/appendix**: Additional figures, videos, and elaboration on methods and computational analysis.

### Poster presentation (10%, group) 

The purpose of a scientific poster is to visually present a summary of your research that complements your interactions with other SPS students or examiner during a poster session. Similar to slides in your presentation, a poster is a visual aid that supports your oral communication of information. 
 
### Oral Viva (20%, individual) 

During the viva, you will be required to answer questions regarding various aspects of your project. Students will be graded on the clarity of explanations and their understanding of the project. Each student will be assessed individually for the Viva. 

### Final presentation (20%, individual) 

**Duration**: Each group will be allocated a 25-minute time slot, comprising of 15 minutes of presentation, 7 minutes of Q&A and 3 minutes of buffer time to set up the slides and to pack up after the entire presentation. 

!!!
All students should arrive punctually and attend the whole duration of SP3172 congress. Non-compliance will result in marks deduction on the overall score. 
!!!

### Continual assessment (10%, individual) 
 
The Continual Assessment is a form of evaluation of the student’s contribution to the project work in the host PI lab and this is graded by the host laboratory PI. 

**Grading component**: The CA grading includes general work attitudes (attendance, initiative and self-motivation), problem solving ability, presentation/communication of ideas, and data analysis during the duration of the project. Students are recommended to be consistently and actively involved in their project and maintain favourable group dynamics with other members of the group. 

**Duration**: The duration over which the continual assessment takes place will be the entire course of the project, from start to end. However, the actual grading of the continual assessment component will take place in the same week as the congress. 

### Mid Semester Abstract/Presentation (10%, group) 

!!! 
Information provided is subject to changes
!!!

The purpose of the mid semester presentations are for students to practice scientific communication via writing an abstract and speaking to an audience about their research project. Presentations will be assessed using the same rubrics meant for the final Oral Presentation to give students a gauge of their work and to receive feedback. Further details will be provided later in the semester.
