# FAQ

## How do I bid / register for SP3172?
SP3172 is a restricted course (for SPS students). Names are directly submitted to the SDO for registration. SPS students who do not intend to take the course must email the SPS staff to inform them. SP3172 will only be pre-allocated in Round 3, so students should ensure they have enough units for it. Students taking SP3172 should still bid for their other courses as usual.

## What is the recommended group size?
You are recommended to complete SP3172 as a group of two or three students. A solo student project is not advised and does not align with the objectives/learning outcomes of SP3172. The workload for a solo project is no different from that of a 3-person group project.

## What is the expected workload of SP3172?
Even though SP3172 is 4 units, the workload is similar to a UROPS project where you have to commit at least 10hrs of work per week. UROPS requires student to do lab work and synthesise meaning from their analysis, which is different from other courses. Therefore, please manage your workload so you can enjoy the process and avoid burnout.

## Does the amount of data determine the success of a research project?
* Data consist of numerical data (presented in table and graphs), gel pictures and microscopy pictures etc'…
* Data does not dictate the outcome, but good description and rational explanation do…
* More data does not necessarily mean it is easier…
* Grading is dependent on your group hitting the criteria in the grading rubrics

## Where can I find the grading rubrics for the various SP3172 deliverables?
* They can be found on the [SP3172 CANVAS page](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/88628), under the Assignment module
   * Scroll down to the end of the assignment instructions to see the rubric
* There are different rubrics for each assessment!

## What are the roles of the SP3172 mentors?
The minimum commitment expected of all SP3172 mentors are as follows:
* Expected to commit at least 10-12 hours across the semester
* Facilitate biweekly discussion
* Ensure group progress, especially deliverables, including
  * Goal-setting (start of semester)
